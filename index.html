            <h1>I'm Brian, a Web Developer</h1>
            <p>
                I am a self-taught web developer, and am excited to break into the industry!  
                Over the last few years learning to code has gradually evolved from a casual hobby to a passion.  
                I have acquired skills in front-end (HTML, CSS, Javascript) as well as backend (Java and SQL) development.</p>
            <p>
                When I'm not coding, I enjoy making music, reading, learning new things and hiking.  
                Please feel free to peruse my projects and don't hesistate to reach out if you have any questions!
            </p>
