        <h2>Excellence in Music Teaching: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>NOW OFFERING LESSONS ONLINE!</strong></h2>
        <img src="/images/pianoWithRosesForWeb.jpg" alt="">
        <p><strong>For more information call us at (515) 252-7664 or
                <a href="contact.php">submit an email request.</a></strong>
        </p>
        <p> If you want to take your musical talent to the next level, you've come
            to the right place. We offer lessons in voice, piano, organ, guitar, flute, drums,
            bass, music theory, composition, and improvisation. Our friendly, highly qualified
            and experienced teachers are here to help.</p>

        <p>Located in the Des Moines metro area, we are near West Des Moines,
        Waukee, Urbandale, Johnston, Grimes, Dallas Center, Clive, Adel and Van Meter as well as other
        communities in the area.</p>

        <p>Whether you just want to explore your innate musical gifts and have fun or you're
            preparing for an important audition, it's never too soon to start and
            never too late to begin experiencing the special joy only music can bring
            to you and your talented family members.</p>

        <p>As you probably already know, many of us feel more complete only when we train to
            make music we enjoy. Often students like to participate in our recital experiences.
            As they develop, they sometimes decide to prepare for auditions,
            win level awards(for example, ABRSM, RCM), and even enter competitions or
            tackle the AP Music Theory Exam.</p>

        <p>Whatever your musical goals, we do our best to make your experience with music
            a most rewarding part of your life.

        <h3>Fun Lessons Plus Proven Results</h3>
        <p> Everyone wants to look forward to their weekly music lesson. That's why we encourage students to
            practice, but we are understanding of busy schedules and life's unforeseen circumstances.
            You will find us ready to encourage you to persist in your musical pursuits.

        <p>Developing musicians need highly qualified music instructors to take them to the
            next level. With Amberlight's teachers and adequate practice on the part of the student,
            progress is virtually assured. Our methods and choice of learning materials have proven over and
            over again to yield solid improvement. We have used many methods, including Suzuki.  Rest assured,
            your curriculum will be designed especially for you.</p>

        <p>Some of our more serious students enter grade level examinations in instruments or voice, theory
            and musicianship. One of the more internationally renowned curricula we have used is ABRSM
            (Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music). Higher levels of achievement are encouraged,
            but certainly not expected of everyone.  We gladly step up or slow down the pace, depending
            on the ever changing needs of the student.</p>

        <p>Virtually all students who study with us for any length of time develop musically, technically,
            spiritually, and intellectually. The happiness, confidence, focus, concentration,
            self discipline, mental development, and sense of mastery can lead to a more fulfilling life.

        <p> Our teachers are highly trained, qualified in their field and come from respected institutions
            such as Stanford University and San Francisco Conservatory of Music. They have extensive experience
            teaching students of all ages.</p>
